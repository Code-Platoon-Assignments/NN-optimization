# Training the Model

## Instructions

In this exercise you'll utilize the [machine_failure.csv](./machine_failure.csv) to build a Binary Classification Model with PyTorch that will evaluate if a Machine is likely to fail or not based on sensor input.

## Steps

- Analyze your data
- Ensure to Scale and Standardize Data
- Divide your data into training and testing sets
- Build your Learning Model with PyTorch `nn.Module`
- Build DataSets and DataLoaders for training and testing
- Train and Evaluate your model
